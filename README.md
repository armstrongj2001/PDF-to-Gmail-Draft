PDF-to-Gmail-Draft
This app script code streamlines the process of creating a PDF file and attaching it to a Gmail draft.
I use this for one of our Estimating Templates in Google Sheets. We do, as a company, 3-5 estimates a day and this helps automate the process.
What I have done is take the current page of the sheet and populate a PDF with the title of the G-sheet file as well as the current sheet.
It then attaches that PDF to a Gmail draft with the Email recipient filled out from the G-sheet information that is provided.
Subject line is then populated with the title of the PDF document. Next the body of the email is filled out with the desired text.
Once this script is ran the draft is saved in your Gmail account until you are ready to send it.
